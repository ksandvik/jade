Jade - Green Zed Code Editor Theme

Based on the Dracula Zed theme. The panes and editor view uses dark green colors. Inspired by the various John Blow 'emacs' themes available for VSCode.

## More instructions

To map .jai files (for the time being) use this in your settings.json:

```json
  "file_types": {
    "C++": ["c", "jai"]
  }
```
The pane fonts can't be changed in the theme, if you want to change these globally, define this in settings.json

```json
  "ui_font_family": "Geneva",
```
